# Markdown Notes Service

This service has three goals:

1. To provide an endpoint which checks markdown grammar of a file (just checks the extension)
2. To provide an endpoint which can perform CRUD tasks on markdown files
3. To provide an endpoint which returns the HTML representation of Markdown
